## Project Details

With the spread of COVID-19, incumbents were forced to either 'save lives' or 'save the economy' in tackling the pandemic. The fact that politicians' choice in this dilemma could affect the odds of staying in the office made this question exceptionally relevant for political science. Economic voting theory predicts that ‘saving the economy’ can positively affect the probability of being re-elected. However, a severe public health threat can shift the electorate’s preferences in favor of expanding healthcare support at the cost of the economy. The goal of the study is to reveal if there is a trade-off between 'saving lives' and 'saving the economy' for the incumbent to get higher political support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on two experimental studies, which were conducted in Russia, with 2x2 factorial design with the factors of ‘saving lives' and ‘saving the economy,’ we measure if individuals are more willing to support the incumbent, vote for them, and extend the incumbent's powers depending on the policy. Though 'saving the economy' had a more consistent effect, both experimental factors encouraged support for the incumbent and their policy. Nevertheless, the economy-driven policy had a larger effect on voting than healthcare-driven one.
